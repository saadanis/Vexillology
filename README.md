#  The Vexillology App
An app for all things vexillology.

## Features
The app features a list of all national flags of the world, which you can filter and group according to region, date founded, ratio, and much more. You can view details - a summary, design, origin, symbolism, and variants, etc. You can choose your favorite flags, or make custom lists. You can test your flag knowledge by playing quizzes. You can also learn about the principles of flag design, best practices, and the nomenclature and glossary of vexillology.
